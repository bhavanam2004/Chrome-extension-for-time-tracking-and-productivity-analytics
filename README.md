The Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics Chrome Extension is a full-stack application designed to help users monitor and optimize their browsing habits. It automatically tracks the time spent on different 

websites and categorizes them as productive or unproductive based on predefined rules or user preferences. The extension also features an analytics dashboard, where users can access weekly reports, productivity 

scores, and time breakdowns to gain insights into their online activities. With a backend system for data storage and processing, the extension ensures seamless tracking, analysis, and report generation, 

enabling users to enhance their productivity effectively.

This project utilizes Chrome Extension APIs to track user activity and store browsing data, while the React.js-based dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for data visualization. The backend, built with 

Node.js and Express.js, handles API requests and securely stores tracking data in MongoDB. Additionally, Firebase or AWS can be integrated for cloud storage and user authentication. Users can customize settings 

by defining which websites are considered productive or unproductive, allowing for a personalized experience. The extension also calculates a productivity score based on browsing behavior, helping users assess 

and improve their efficiency over time.

The project is structured into two main parts: the Chrome extension frontend and the backend server. The frontend includes files such as background.js for handling time tracking, content.js for monitoring 

activity within web pages, and popup.js for the extensionâ€™s interface. The dashboard, built with React.js, consists of components that display data visually. The backend includes an Express.js server, API 

routes, and MongoDB models to store and manage tracked time logs efficiently. This modular architecture ensures flexibility and scalability for future enhancements.

To install and run the project, users need to clone the repository, install dependencies, and start both the backend server and dashboard. The backend can be started by running node server.js, while the React-

based dashboard can be launched using npm start. The extension must be loaded manually into Chrome via chrome://extensions/, where users can enable Developer Mode and load the src folder as an unpacked 

extension. Once installed, the extension tracks browsing activity, updates data in the backend, and provides real-time insights through the dashboard.

In future updates, the extension could integrate AI-based website classification, allowing for automatic categorization of websites based on browsing patterns. Additional features like goal setting, improved 

data visualization, and cloud synchronization for multiple devices can enhance its functionality. The project is licensed under the MIT License, making it open for contributions and improvements from the 

developer community. Users and contributors can raise issues, suggest features, or submit pull requests to refine and expand the extension.

This Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics Chrome Extension serves as an effective tool for individuals looking to manage their digital time better. By providing real-time tracking, categorized reports, and 

insightful analytics, it helps users identify distractions, optimize work hours, and boost overall productivity.
